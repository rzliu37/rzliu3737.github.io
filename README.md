### Research interest 

HBE | SNA | Kinship | Cooperation & Social Structure | Lithic Analysis | Prehistory Archaeology

As an anthropologist, I am interested in human cooperation pattern and their social structure. My current project focuses on the individual's social networks and the function of kinship under market integration. I explore this question by using theories grounded in evolutionary theory, such as Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE) and Cultural evolution theory (CET). My project involves qualitative and quantitive analysis, especially social network analysis (SNA). 

As an archaeologiest, I am interested in the human behaviors and technology in prehistory world. I focus on their adaptive strategies via ethnography, lithic analysis and experiments.
